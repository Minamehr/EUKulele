Bio.Alphabet has been removed from Biopython. In many cases, the alphabet can simply be ignored and removed from scripts. In a few cases, you may need to specify the ``molecule_type`` as an annotation on a SeqRecord for your script to work correctly. Please see https://biopython.org/wiki/Alphabet for more information.
There was a problem installing BUSCO or importing one of its dependencies. See the user guide and the GitLab issue board (https://gitlab.com/ezlab/busco/issues) if you need further assistance.
